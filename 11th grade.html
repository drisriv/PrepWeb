    <h2>General Advice</h2>
    <p>1. Explore college options and create a list. During the summer between your junior and senior year, narrow down your college list to 2 safety schools, 4-5 match schools, and 2-3 reach schools.  </p>
    <p>2. Make sure you are meeting the requirements for graduation as well as requirements for colleges you want to apply for.</p>
    <p>3. Take the SAT and ACT and decide which one you prefer more and work on improving your score on that test. Most colleges will take either your SAT or your ACT but of course this depends on what college you are applying too. </p>
    <p>4. Look into financial aid or scholarships that you can apply for. </p>
    <p>5. Consider looking into summer internships or jobs. This gives you a chance to gain real-world experience before going off to colllege. </p>
    <p>6. When exploring colleges to add your list, consider location, size, type, and student body. Do you want to attend a college with a huge campus with thousands of students or a small, intimate college with smaller classroom sizes? Do I want to live on campus or find an apartment that is near campus? Can you picture yourself fitting in and enjoying yourself there? These and many other factors are important when choosing which colleges you potentially will attend. </p>
