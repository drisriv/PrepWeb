  <div class="generalAdvice">
    <h3>General Advice</h3>
    <p>1. Meet with your counselor and discuss what classes you are interested in taking and whether you are eligible for them. Some schools may even offer opportunities such as dual enrollment which gives you the chance to start taking college courses as a high schooler. </p>
    <p> 2. Get involved in your school. This includes participating in clubs, sports, the student council, and other various extracurricular activities. Find what you are passionate about and join clubs related to your interest(s). </p>
    <p> 3. Volunteer around your community. Some schools or clubs may require students to aquire volunteer hours but besides volunteering just to get hours, you should volunteer to connect with your community. You'll gain new experience and skills as well as make meaningful memories and connections.</p>
    <p> 4. Get good grades. Freshman year is not the time to slack off! The grades you earn freshman year will still count towards your GPA </p>
    <p> 5. Challenge yourself by taking honors and AP classes, but don't take on more then you can handle. Know your limits and set goals for yourself. </p>
